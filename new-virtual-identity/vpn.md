# VPN

### Providers

#### ProtonVPN

It comes handy with having ProtonMail and ProtonVPN used together, having single subscription for both.

### Setup

* Integrate VPN profile into your Router and enable kill switch (advanced, but ideal setup).
* Install ProtonVPN app and use country that you define in your virtual identity and enable kill switch. (if router option is not available)

A VPN kill switch is **a feature that automatically disconnects your computer, phone, or tablet from the internet if your VPN connection drops out.** This means there's no chance that your IP address and other sensitive information could be exposed if VPN stops working.
